# Higher order functions in JavaScript seminar

Load index.html in your browser.  Open your browser console to see the results of running the tests on map() and reduce().

See code.js for sample implementations of map(), reduce() and compose().

Agenda

* Higher order functions, part one: functions that take functions as arguments.
* Map, reduce and how they work.  (As in functional programming, not distributed computing.)
* Crash course in prototypal inheritance.
* Brief aside on making a shim to allow use of non-standard JS features like map and reduce.
* Break into pairs and write some code:
  * Implement map and reduce from scratch.
  * Reimplement map as a reduce.
* Higher order functions, part two: functions that return functions.
* Compose function example: square and sum an array
* Break into pairs and write some code:
  * Implement a compose that will take any number of functions.
